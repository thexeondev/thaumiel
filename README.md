# Thaumiel

**Thaumiel** is a client patch for the game **Zenless Zone Zero**. It's designed to work with the [Remielle Server Emulator](https://git.xeondev.com/remielle/remielle).

## Requirements
To build **Thaumiel** from sources you need:
- Zig Compiler, version `0.16.0`: [Linux](https://ziglang.org/download/0.16.0/zig-x86_64-linux-0.16.0.tar.xz)/[Windows](https://ziglang.org/download/0.16.0/zig-x86_64-windows-0.16.0.zip)

#### Currently supported client version: `CNBetaWin3.2.4`, it can be found in our [discord server](https://discord.xeondev.com/)

## Steps to compile and run
```sh
git clone https://git.xeondev.com/remielle/thaumiel.git
cd thaumiel
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
mv zig-out/bin/remielle.exe zig-out/bin/thaumiel.dll PATH_TO_CLIENT/
```
#### NOTE: "PATH_TO_CLIENT" must be replaced with the actual path to the game directory.

## Configuration
**Thaumiel** is configured by editing files in the `assets` directory and (re-)compiling its source code.
- URL from `login_setting.json` are used to communicate with the dispatch server (dpsv)
- URLs from `server_pc.json` are used to communicate with the SDK server (sdksv)
- `sdk_public_key.xml` is the RSA key used for communication with the SDK server
- `server_public_key.xml` is the RSA key used for communication with dispatch and game servers
- `offsets.zon` contains version-specific values
